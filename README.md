# Bellabeat Case Study

## About the project

This case study is my additional capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. My personal goal for this second case study was to keep experimenting with RStudio Desktop, especially with data visualizations using 'ggplot2' and to practice the skill set I acquired during the course.

## Business Objective

* Analyze publicly available fitness tracker data in order to gain insights into how consumers are using their smart devices. 

* Identify trends that will help determine *Bellabeat*'s marketing strategy in the future.

## Method

Analyze a public dataset containing personal fitness tracker data from thirty *FitBit* users to explore the users' daily habits, including physical activity, calories burned and sleep quality through a period of two month.

## Deliverables

1. Summary of the business task
2. Description of the data sources, including information on credibility and bias
3. Documentation of data cleaning and manipulation
4. Description of datasets selected for analysis
5. Summary of the analysis and key takeaways
6. Supporting visualizations
7. Top recommendation for the company based on the analysis
